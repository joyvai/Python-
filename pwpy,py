# You probably have accounts on many different websites. It’s a bad habit to
# use the same password for each of them because if any of those sites has
# a security breach, the hackers will learn the password to all of your other
# accounts. It’s best to use password manager software on your computer that
# uses one master password to unlock the password manager. Then you can
# copy any account password to the clipboard and paste it into the website’s
# Password field.
# The password manager program you’ll create in this example isn’t
# secure, but it offers a basic demonstration of how such programs work.
# Since you want
# to associate each account’s name with its password, you can store these as
# strings in a dictionary. The dictionary will be the data structure that orga-
# nizes your account and password data. Make your program look like the
# following:

# python3
#pw.py = An insecure password locker program

passwords = {'email': 'F7minlBDDuvMJuxESSKHFhTxFtjVB6'
			'blog':'VmALvQyKAxiVH5G8v01if1MLZF3sdt',
			'luggage': '12345'} 

import sys,pyperclip
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
	print ('Usage: python pw.py [account] - copy account password')
	sys.exit()
account = sys.argv[1] 
# copy the right password

if account in PASSWORDS:
	pyperclip.copy(PASSWORDS[account])
	print ('Password for ' + account + ' copied to clipboard.')
else:
	print ('There is no account named ' + account)

# This new code looks in the PASSWORDS dictionary for the account name.
# If the account name is a key in the dictionary, we get the value correspond-
# ing to that key, copy it to the clipboard, and print a message saying that we
# copied the value. Otherwise, we print a message saying there’s no account
# with that name.
